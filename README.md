This is my side project about Accessibility tests.

The aim of this project is to evaluate and improve the accessibility of websites in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The project focuses on identifying barriers that may hinder the use of websites by people with various disabilitiesâ€”such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

The project will involve accessibility testing of selected websites using both automated tools and manual testing, including participation from users with disabilities. The analysis will cover elements such as: color contrast, keyboard accessibility, proper heading structure, alternative image descriptions, and the structure of forms and navigation.

The final outcome of the project will be a report that includes:

    an assessment of compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards,

    a list of identified issues,

    recommendations for improvements,

    best practices for designing accessible websites.

The goal of the project is not only to detect accessibility issues but also to raise awareness about the needs of people with disabilities and promote the creation of more inclusive and user-friendly digital interfaces.
